                        <p>Hi all, I’m Bridget! I'm very excited to be serving as the CSSA president for this school year. Cog sci has exposed me to a variety of amazing teachers and classes here at Berkeley, and joining CSSA has been a great way to meet fellow students with many talents and interests, brain related and beyond. In addition to creating a fun place for any and all with an interest in cognitive science, I hope that CSSA can provide a venue to explore the many related fields of cognitive science science and build a strong community of interdisciplinary scholars and brain enthusiasts. Outside of school, I work in cognitive development research and every other weekend, drive back to Davis to help with the UCD Surgical Internship. I love animals, music, taking & editing photos, and riding my bike in the early evening. Feel free to shoot me an email (bvmacdonald@berkeley.edu) or talk to me at our next meeting – look forward to meeting you!</p>

I've been a part of CSSA since my freshmen year and have enjoyed every moment. I'll be working as your external Vice President this year. We got a great team all ready to work and I cannot be more excited. CSSA in general is a very chill student organization, eating and chatting, but we are all passionate about what we do. I'm interested in perception, neurodegenerative diseases and consciousness. I'm currently working at the Whitney Lab, doing some fMRI data processing for vision studies. Outside of CSSA, I sleep, draw, travel and do some intense karaoke. Don't hesitate to contact me about cognitive science, pre-med, MCB, and about life in general! I look forward to another great year!!</p>

I'm more interested in the computational modeling and neuroscience side of cog sci and specifically in modeling learning systems, although I get pretty excited over most anything cog sci related. I am a research assistant in Professor Ivry's Cognition and Action lab where I work on computational models of motor learning systems in the brain. Outside of school, I enjoy playing soccer, running, hiking, and working in the UC Botanical garden. I'll be around at most every CSSA gathering so feel free to ask me questions about the major or anything else you'd like to chat about.</p>

                        <p> Hi! I'm Sabrina, a third-year CogSci major and Spanish Language minor. I am beyond excited to take over as Outreach Coordinator this year. My job will be to arrange CSSA's support and participation in local events, and also work with local schools to organize and teach lessons that introduce young students to neuroscience, basic methods used in scientific research, and the amazing powers of higher-level education. Last summer I worked in Dr. Bob Clark's lab at UCSD, researching the processes of memory in the mammalian brain, and next spring I will be traveling to Barcelona for six months to study psychology (in Spanish!) at the University of Barcelona. I love to go hiking, bake cookies, and sing in the shower. If you ever need help around campus or just an ice cream buddy, I’m your girl!</p>

I will be taking over for Sabrina as Outreach Coordinator  while she is livin la vida loca in Barcelona. My favorite part of Outreach is going to schools to teach fifth graders about neuroscience. Seeing their reactions, curiosity, and *sometimes* disgust as they feel dead brains is entertainment in itself. I would definitely recommend getting involved!  I'm also an RA at the Berkeley Early Learning Lab, where I study cognitive development. I enjoy coffee, exploring, and artsy things. Feel free to email email me at jessramber@berkeley.edu !  </p>

I spend summers conducting research at a Navy sleep lab and work with Professor Michael Ranney here at Berkeley to develop and spread clear explanations of the science behind climate change. I plan to get a master’s or Ph.D. in psychology/cog sci. When not focused on classes (ask me about my 1700-page textbook), I play jazz trombone, find absurd news stories to pin on my Wall of Shame, and co-facilitate the Berkeley Review Of CogSci Articles (BROCA) DeCal. I’m looking forward to meeting you all and sharing my love of this fascinating field. </p>

It’s my honor to be the technological virtuoso for CSSA this year. I am curious about anything related to perception and consciousness and particularly topics like sensory processing and encoding. I am currently a research assistant in Feldman Lab where I study how tactile information is extracted and processed and encoded in sensory cortex. And I also work in Levi Lab at optometry department where I run psychophysics experiment to study binocular mechanisms. For something that is not science related, I enjoy painting, traveling and any outdoor activities on mountains or water. I am looking forward to meeting all of you who share the same passion with me and the CSSA. :) </p>

I’m a second year Cognitive Science major with an emphasis is Cognitive Neuroscience. I’m pre-med, hoping to pursue a career in clinical neurology after Cal. I’ve always been fascinated by the mind and I loved the way CogSci allows us to take such a diverse and thorough approach to uncovering the mystery that is the human mind. Outside of CSSA, I am a research assistant at the D’Esposito Lab where I use fMRI and TMS to study memory and metacognition in the prefrontal cortex, and am professional chair of PhiDE. When I’m not studying or playing with brains, I can be found at concerts, shooting and editing photographs, cooking, or going on foodie adventures.

This past summer, I worked as a research assistant in the Knight Cognitive Neuroscience lab and a TA for CS 10. I developed and teach a DeCal all about professional wrestling – 3 semesters strong, which I really enjoy. I’ve also worked at Sandia National Laboratories for several years as a biology research intern.
