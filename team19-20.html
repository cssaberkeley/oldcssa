I'm really looking forward to another year of teaching people about brains and organizing the greatest conference ever. Outside of classes and CSSA, I also work in a lab on campus studying memory and decision making. Besides the brain, I love ceramics, skiing, baking, teaching, anything by Toni Morrison, and languages. Feel free to come talk to me about CSSA, the major, neuroscience research, or your favorite dog breeds!</p>

I initially wanted to be a cognitive science major, and that’s how I found this wonderful organization. Even when I decided MCB was the right major for me, I still wanted to be in CSSA because the club is very welcoming and hosts amazing events! I will be one of the co-vice presidents this year and am looking forward to all of the events this semester and getting to know everyone in the club.  I also enjoy spending my time working in a research lab, doing triathlons, hiking, surfing, and exploring the Bay!</p>

As one of the Vice Presidents, I’m excited to continue building a space for people who share our love for all things Cognitive Science. Feel free to come talk to me about personality types, interesting TED talks, Vanessa Van Edwards, identity crises, and/or health-nut how-tos. When I'm not in class or at CSSA meetings, I can be found thinking about food, swimming, cooking, and hanging out *procrastinating* with friends. </p>

I'm looking forward to being this year’s Marketing Director, and promoting our events (like Conference!) across campus. I chose to study cognitive science since I’m particularly interested in why people think the way they do, and how it can be applied to information technology. Apart from CSSA, I enjoy being a part of robotics and STEM outreach, reading, laser-cutting/design, and all things security! </p>

Outside of class and this super fun club, which has showed me how much you can do with a CogSci degree, I'm writing an honors thesis, training for a half-marathon, and sleeping 7-8 hours every night (and willing to convince you to do so too). I'd be happy to recommend some true crime podcasts, gush over Malcom Gladwell's books, or rehearse our impending auditions for the role of Peggy in the Hamilton musical. But please find me and we'll chat if you want to talk about CogSci (the best CS), sleep, imposter syndrome, or being a community college transfer student! Cheers to a great year! </p>

I love brains and am especially interested in the evolution of the brain. As one of the outreach coordinators I will be showing  people how amazing the human brain is and enthusiastically answering "yes" when they ask "is it a real human brain?" When I have time to actually live my life I enjoy doing nothing with my friends, exploring Trader Joe's,  and spying on my cat through my family's security camera. If you ever want a study buddy you don't even need to hit me up just spot me at Kresge/Moffit cuz I basically live in them. </p>
