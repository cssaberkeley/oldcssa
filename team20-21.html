I'm interested in all things design, so feel free to ask me any question regarding campus opportunities in design! Before CSSA, I didn’t know any other CogSci majors; CSSA gave me the resources and support that I was looking for, not to mention many friends and experiences <3 In addition to CSSA, I'm part of Songwriting at Berkeley - on a normal semester, you can catch me busking in front of Wheeler. Come join our community - I can't wait to meet you!</p>

Even when I decided MCB was the right major for me, I still wanted to be in CSSA because the club is very welcoming and hosts amazing events! I will be one of the co-vice presidents this year and am looking forward to all of the events this semester and getting to know everyone in the club.  I also enjoy spending my time working in a research lab, doing triathlons, hiking, surfing, and exploring the Bay!</p>

                        <p>Hiya! I'm a fourth year Cognitive Science transfer student from Santa Rosa Junior College in Sonoma, CA! Outside of class and this super fun club, which has showed me how much you can do with a CogSci degree, I'm writing an honors thesis, training for a half-marathon, and sleeping 7-8 hours every night (and willing to convince you to do so too). I'd be happy to recommend some true crime podcasts, gush over Malcom Gladwell's books, or rehearse our impending auditions for the role of Peggy in the Hamilton musical. But please find me and we'll chat if you want to talk about CogSci (the best CS), sleep, imposter syndrome, or being a community college transfer student! Cheers to a great year! </p>

I joined CSSA my first semester and I've been definitely loving our community and the amazing activities like alumni talk, pizza night, and Conference (even though we couldn't have it last year, I loved planning for the event!) I wanted to learn more about the human mind and connect the knowledge to understand how decision making works! In my free time, I love editing videos for my Youtube channel, chasing the sunsets/ finding hidden spots for beautiful scenery, or reading through the Myers & Briggs personality types lol. I'm excited to meet the new members and chat about any of these if you want to!</p>

                        <p>Hi! I'm Kavya, and I'm a second-year double majoring in Cognitive Science and Data Science. I am excited to be your University Relations officer this year and help strengthen the CogSci community at Berkeley especially in our virtual environment this year. Outside of class and this club, you can find me training for a half marathon, singing, baking crazy desserts, or binge-watching Netflix shows. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about Cog Sci or Data Science, life at Berkeley, cool places to explore in the Bay, or anything else!</p>

                        <p>Hi! I’m Nicole, and I’m a sophomore pursuing a cognitive science major and education minor. I’m excited to serve as alumni coordinator this year and work towards strengthening our CogSci community! Outside of classes, I work in a lab studying consciousness on a neural basis. I also enjoy baking, hiking, trying different types of food, and exploring new places! I’m always down to grab coffee and chat about mental health, imposter syndrome, neuroscience, and more!</p>
