Outside of the CSSA, I'm also involved with The Baby Lab, The Golden Bear Sleep and Mood Research Clinic, Berkeley Careers in Entertainment Club (BCEC), Berkeley B-Side, ResComp, and REACH!'s True Asian Leaders. ON the side, I love being outdoors, music, skateboarding and photography! So if you ever want to take photos while dangerously (but responsibly) bombing some steep hills in a secluded forest road while blasting "Reptilia" by The Strokes -- I'm your guy. </p>

I joined CSSA in my first semester at Cal and have never looked back. You can look forward to a fantastic year with awesome people in this club. I know I am. When I’m not in class or CSSA, I’m watching Netflix, cooking incessantly, jamming to obscure music, or bemoaning the neoliberal regime.

I am pursuing a career in medicine, most likely in clinical neurology, and will be attending medical school once I graduate. Outside of class, I spend my time studying the brain as an undergraduate researcher at the D’Esposito Cognitive Neuroscience Lab where I use fMRI and TMS to study memory, executive function, metacognition, and mood. Outside of CSSA, I also run an online biomedical publication called Morning Sign Out, and love traveling, cooking, dancing, Netflixing and listening to French music. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the best major on campus (CogSci), being pre-med, or life in general! I’m looking forward to an amazing year with you all!</p>

My job will be to arrange CSSA's support and participation in local events, and also coordinate with local schools to organize and teach lessons that introduce young students to neuroscience, basic methods used in scientific research, and the amazing powers of higher-level education. Last semester I traveled to Barcelona to study psychology (in Spanish!) at the University of Barcelona and had the opportunity to explore Europe. I love to go hiking, bake cookies, and sing in the shower. If you ever want to talk about brains, need help around campus, advice on how to get involved in your community, or just an ice cream buddy, I’m your girl!

                        <p> Hi all! My name is Satya, and I am excited to be your University Relations Director for the 2015-16 academic year! I am a third-year Cognitive Science and Neurobiology (MCB) major on the premed track, and I have been a part of CSSA since my second semester at Cal. I am fascinated by the brain and mind, and am particularly interested in neural circuitry, mental illnesses, and nondualist philosophy.  I currently work in the Wilbrecht Lab, where I study the role of the dorsomedial striatum (part of a brain region called the basal ganglia) in action selection. I also co-facilitate the Berkeley Review of CogSci Articles (BROCA) DeCal course, which I highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the cognitive sciences! When I’m not doing academic things, I enjoy Netflix, reading, watching football, and exploring the great outdoors.  I’m excited for another fantastic year with CSSA— feel free to send me an email (satyavedula@berkeley.edu) or chat with me at our next meeting! </p>

I just got back from a year abroad in Scotland and am excited to be back in Berkeley. I love the interdisciplinary nature of CogSci and  have always been fascinated by the way that people think. The Cognitive Science Students Association was the first club I joined at Berkeley my freshman year, and I've always loved the inclusive and fun atmosphere it has. I'm excited for what this year has in store and can't wait to get to know new members!! Come talk about brains (or anything else) with us! </p>

I'm a third year Cognitive Science major and Computer Science minor, and am interested in robotics, human-computer interaction, human-centered design, and product management. On campus, I work at the Knight Lab and am also involved in Pioneers in Engineering, a club that hosts a yearly robotics competition for high school teams around the Bay Area. Last year, I was a mentor for a team, and this year, I'll be staffing. When I'm not doing things around campus, I'm probably cooking, watching superhero movies, or listening to bad rap.

I have the wonderful honor of being CSSA's historian this year. Don't think I'm stalking you, if I have my camera lens aimed at you. I'm just doing my job to record all the fun events CSSA puts on. When I'm not studying all things brain-related, I am gulping down massive quantities of tea and pastries, doing some yoga at Yoga to the People, hiking, cooking, watching embarrassingly bad TV, and doodling. If you have any questions about Cog Sci or what reality tv show to watch next, please come talk to me!</p>
