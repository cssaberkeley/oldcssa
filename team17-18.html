                        <p>Hi all! I’m Nora, a fourth year Cog Sci major. During my first semester at Cal, I saw some weird people holding brains on Sproul and that’s when I knew I had found my people and needed to join CSSA. I’m super excited to be working with my awesome fellow officers to build the Cog Sci community here at Berkeley and equally as excited to get to know some more brain enthusiasts at our meetings this year. Outside of CSSA, I’m a research assistant in Anne Collins’s Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab where I do research on learning and decision-making using EEG and computational modeling. If I’m not in CSSA or lab, I’m probably browsing random Wikipedia articles, trying out new recipes, knitting ugly scarves, and dancing badly to good music. Feel free to come talk to me about anything from striatal cholinergic interneurons to reality tv dating shows.</p>

Outside of doing my vice president duties, I love cooking vegetarian food, reading science biographies, cross-stitching feminist quotes, and rock climbing. I'm looking forward to another fantastic year of talking about brains and going to Tandoori Nite after meetings!

I study time perception via TMS and fMRI in the Ivry Lab, though that realistically means I spend most of my time wrestling with a finicky TMS setup. You can find me around campus cooking, practicing various martial arts, rock climbing, knitting, juggling, making (mediocre) music, working at Lawrence Hall of Science, and hiding in bio labs pretending to be an MCB major. Come talk to me about being overly interested in things, about the things you're overly interested in, or if you just feel like you need to revitalize your CogSci mojo by petting a brain.</p>

I look forward to helping CSSA take a more active role in the academic lives of CogSci students, from enrollment advising and office hours to helping them create the major program they want! In general, I'm fascinated by the brain and all that it's capable of, especially when it comes to learning and memory. I absolutely love being a Cognitive Science major and I love sharing what I've learned even more; so don't hesitate to come to me with any questions you may have, from how to make the most of course waitlists to getting involved in research and everything in between! When I'm not buried in coursework and research I enjoy studying foreign languages and consuming stories.</p>

I'll be CSSA's treasurer this year. I'm nervous because it's a big responsibility handling money, but I'm also really excited and am looking forward to a fun and wonderful year with CSSA. Outside of club and classes, I like to read, watch movies and anime, trying new food, or just chilling with my peeps. CSSA was the first club I joined and I'm so happy I found them! This organization means a lot for me and I hope you can discover something that will stick with you here too!</p>

I've been in CSSA since my first semester at Cal when I was still trying to figure out what CogSci was, and I'm super excited to be a part of it this year as well. I’m interested in studying the brain from a more biological perspective, but I also love how interdisciplinary Cognitive Science is. Feel free to come talk to me about CSSA, the major, Neuroscience research on campus, or your favorite dog breeds! Besides the brain, my other interests include ceramics, teaching, languages, anything by Toni Morrison, and musicals.</p>
