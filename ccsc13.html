His groundbreaking research on the molecular basis of memory has led to his discovery of PKMzeta, a protein kinase believed to be important for maintaining long term memories in the hippocampus. This discovery was cited by the journal Science as one of 2006’s “Breakthroughs of the Year"ʺ and has been highlighted by the popular press. In 2012 he became a recipient of the prestigious MERIT award from the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
