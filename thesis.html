                    <p> Cognitive science majors may culminate their study in cognitive science with an honors thesis. The honors thesis is a report on an independent research project completed by the student. The <a href="http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/honors"> <u> cognitive science program honors thesis page</u></a> holds all of the official information and details about the honors thesis. However, one major resource it lacks is examples of what past cognitive science theses look like. Thus, the CSSA has started an honors thesis archive containing past cognitive science honors theses. Hopefully, they will make the notion of an honors thesis a bit more concrete and alleviate some of the initial burden in the writing process. If you are a graduating major and would like to include your honors thesis in the archive, please send an email to cssa.berkeley@gmail.com with a pdf of your thesis attached and the relevant information (see entries below) included in the body of the email.

It'll give you an answer very quickly whether or not you want to pursue it. 2) If you can, try to take as few classes as possible your last semester while you're finishing up your thesis. It's really nice to be able to spend over 20 hours a week on it and not have to worry about also juggling 4 to 5 classes. 3) Meet with your advisor as often as possible and ask for advice from your second reader. I didn't use my second reader at all, but retrospectively, I think she would have been happy to give me advice that would've improved the quality of my thesis. 5) Come May, you'll hate your thesis and will never want to talk about it again because it is a piece of flaming garbage, but wait a couple of months and you'll come to like discussing it again.  6) Literally, no one is done in time for the Glushko prize, so just submit something no matter what state your thesis is in. So few people apply because it's an early deadline and they think everyone else has their shit together. No one has their shit together. Just submit it. </p>

Also, it's really really important to have an advisor who can meet with you frequently to give you advice or feedback on your project (especially if you're starting late, like I did). Some professors may not have this kind of time, so don't be afraid to ask a senior graduate student or post-doc to be your co-advisor! </p>

                    <p style="margin:0px;"> <span style="color:#279487">Thesis Summary:</span> Gestures are nonverbal, visible indexes of cognition (Hostetter & Alibali, 2008), interesting in part for what they reveal of mental representations on behalf of a speaker during communication. While study of those performing gesture is extensive, a great deal is yet to be understood about the role gesture serves for those viewing it. In an empirical study we explore how viewing gesture that accompanies speech (co-speech gesture) impacts memory and mental representation of a story scene relayed in English to both native and non-native English speakers. We find that gesture is significantly associated with accurate memory of an episodic story scene – an effect driven by non-native, but not native, speakers of English. Across participants, gesture provides surprisingly minimal aid to accurate recall of gesture-only story details. We consider differences in viewpoint along with spatial and temporal directionality norms for native English speakers as potential explanatory factors. </p>

A revised version of my thesis was published in the Spring 2017 Undergraduate Journal of Psychology at Berkeley.  I was also awarded the Robert J. Glushko Prize for Distinguished Undergraduate Research in Cognitive Science for the thesis. I include that information to encourage anyone with even an inkling toward completing a thesis to do so. It isn't about perfection (mine is clearly far from it), but rather about putting in the effort and actually getting it done. I was a transfer student, so timing and taking action were really critical. I began planning the project in the late Spring of my Junior year, designed, conducted the experiment, and began analysis during that summer abroad. I completed the analysis and write-up during the Fall of my senior year." </p>

                    <p style="margin:0px;"> <span style="color:#279487">Thesis Summary:</span> In 2008, Goldin-Meadow et al. claimed that SOV is the ‘Natural Order of Events’ with regards to gestural communication order. Our study addresses potential confounds concerning task-based and corpus-based informativeness. In our study’s experiments, English speakers played a communication game to assess the influence of communicative pressure, English Language Statistics, and Game Statistics on gestural communication order. Our results indicate that people attend to relative informativeness given communicative pressure, but that they do not use relative informativeness to determine communicative order. </p>
                    <p style="margin:0px;"> <span style="color:#279487">Tip for Students Writing a Thesis:</span> Working on an undergraduate honors thesis is the perfect way to run into all of the chaos and failures involved in research. It'll be long and it'll be messy, but that's ok! I recommend starting early by coming up with a long list of research questions and check them with a grad student mentor because many will be difficult to test or may not be an appropriate scope for 1 year. I ended up taking a gap year after graduation which ended up being useful. Had I applied for grad school in my senior year, I would not have even started working on the research that I fell in love with (my Linguistics thesis, see below). Don't worry about an undergrad thesis being perfect or that you'll be tied to that work in the future. Use it as a way to figure out what you like and dislike about research. </p>

                    <p style="margin:0px;"> <span style="color:#279487">Thesis Summary:</span> In 2012, Frank and Goodman proposed a Bayesian model of pragmatic inference which had a near perfect correlation with participant responses when asked to communicate about simple geometric stimuli. For my honor’s thesis project, I have tested their model in the more complicated and naturalistic domain of space.  </p>

                    <p style="margin:0px;"> <span style="color:#279487">Thesis Advisor:</span> Alison Gopnik & Rich Ivry </p>
                    <p style="margin:0px;"> <span style="color:#279487">Thesis Summary:</span> This project builds off of research in computational cognitive development, finding that children are sometimes better learners, while adults are subject to learning biases. Here, we examine whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS – a non-invasive brain stimulation method) can diminish cognitive control, and hence, this learning bias when the cathode electrode is applied to prefrontal cortex of adults. Results are trending, although not significant, adding to the conversation about the efficacy of tDCS. </p>
                    <p style="margin:0px;"> <span style="color:#279487">Tip for Students Writing a Thesis:</span> Find a mentor (professor, post doc, grad student) who is accessible and willing to read a handful of drafts and provide critical feedback. A good way to estimate how much time you will need for every aspect of the project is to take your initial estimate and multiply it by pi.</p>

                    <p style="margin:0px;"> <span style="color:#279487">Thesis Summary:</span> If someone is conditioned to fear something, there is some dispute as to whether they are conditioned to be afraid of each of the fear inducing stimulus's parts as well (eg. if you were conditioned to fear red cars, would you also fear the color red). We examined the extent of this effect and whether it varies depending on the individual's anxiety level. </p>
                    <p style="margin:0px;"> <span style="color:#279487">Tip for Students Writing a Thesis:</span> Really take initiative. You really do get what you put in and it's very easy to get caught up in schoolwork and put off your research involvement. There isn't really a set amount of work you should put in so I would take some time to figure out what you want to get out of doing undergraduate research and keep in constant contact with your advisor to make sure you are getting those types of responsibilities.  </p>
