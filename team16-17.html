                        <p>Hi there! Name’s Tim. I’m fourth year Cognitive Science and MCB double major (Computer Science minor) who is fascinated by all aspects of the brain and mind from biochemistry to behavior to artificial intelligence. I joined CSSA in my first semester at Cal and have never looked back. You can look forward to a fantastic year with awesome people in this club. I know I am. When I’m not in class or CSSA, I’m watching Netflix, cooking incessantly, jamming to obscure music, or bemoaning the neoliberal regime. Feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions about life, the universe, or anything (hint: the answer is 42.)</p>

                        <p>Hello Brain Scholars! As Internal VP, I make sure CSSA is a fun, informative, and social environment for all of its members. This means improving person-to-person connections, facilitating discussion, and making sure CSSA is one, big, happy fam! At Cal, I'm a 4th year Cognitive Science major with a Computer Science minor, and would like to go into usability and user experience research after graduation. Outside of classes, I do research in the Knight Lab, where I work with EEG data to find the neural basis for social interactions. Talk to me about research, internships, brains, CS, food (especially food), or anything else! </p>

As Outreach Coordinator, I organize CSSA's involvement in local events and lead one of (in my completely unbiased opinion) our coolest programs: our elementary school neuroscience lessons.  You can find me around campus cooking, practicing various martial arts, rock climbing, knitting, juggling, making (mediocre) music, working at Lawrence Hall of Science, and hiding in bio labs pretending to be an MCB major.  Come talk to me about being overly interested in things, about the things you're overly interested in, or if you just feel like you need to revitalize your CogSci mojo by petting a brain. </p>

                        <p> Hey Everyone! I'm Satya, and I am super excited to be returning as your University Relations Director for the 2016-2017 year! I am a senior Cognitive Science and MCB-Neuro major here at Berkeley, and I have been in CSSA since my second semester at Cal. I am on the pre-med track, and I am planning on pursuing a career in behavioral neurology. You've probably figured out that I am fascinated by the brain and mind- I'm particularly interested in decision-making, mental illnesses, and philosophy of cognition. I'm currently in my second year working in Linda Wilbrecht's lab here on campus, where I study the role of the dorsomedial striatum in decision-making. I also facilitate the Berkeley Review of CogSci Articles (BROCA) DeCal course, which I highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about research in Cognitive Science! In my free time, I love to play racquetball, read, watch Netflix & football, and explore the great outdoors. If you ever want to chat about brains, need help around campus, or want a hiking/food buddy, I'm your guy! Email me at satyavedula@berkeley.edu.</p>

I'll be CSSA's treasurer this year. I'm nervous because it's a big responsibility handling money, but I'm also really excited and am looking forward to a fun and wonderful year with CSSA. Outside of club and classes, I like to read, watch movies and anime, trying new food, or just chilling with my peeps. CSSA was the first club I joined and I'm so happy I found them! This organization means a lot for me and I hope you can discover something that will stick with you here too!</p>

As a freshman, CSSA provided an extremely useful resources for navigating the major and this website is a hub for all those wonderful resources. Thus, I am super excited to be CSSA's Techological Virtuoso this year because I have the privilege of being in charge of this website. If you think something would be helpful to add or should be changed, I'd love to hear from you. Before you go, I'd like to mention that I love animation, doodling, musicals (despite my non-existent musical ability), and adventuring in the Berkeley Hills. You are more than welcome to email me at averyyoon@berkeley.edu if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or you just want to chat. </p>

I'm fascinated by the brain and all that it's capable of, especially when it comes to learning and memory. I absolutely love being a Cognitive Science major and I love sharing what I've learned even more so don't hesitate to come to me with any questions you may have from how to make the most of course waitlists to getting involved in research and everything in between!
