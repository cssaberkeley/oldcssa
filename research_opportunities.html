                                    <p> Two post-doc research opportunities are available with the 711th Air Force Research Lab - Human Performance Wing (AFRL-HPW), located in Dayton, OH.  U.S. Citizenship is REQUIRED.  This opportunity includes, but is not limited to, the following:

                                    This opportunity supports the Air Force Research Labs research efforts in advancing our understanding of the biological mechanisms of human performance. The overarching scientific question that drives our research is the following: "How do individuals adapt and what are the biological mechanisms that facilitate adaptation?". This research explores how environmental conditions (stress, exercise, diet, electroceuticals) interact with biological mechanisms to modulate physiological functions. We utilize a variety of techniques (e.g. immunohistochemistry, neurobehavioral assays, brain stimulation, behavioral genetics models, sequencing, bioinformatics) to advance our understanding in this area. The integration of these methods allows us to tackle challenging problems that require multiple skill sets, various disciplines and creative approaches. The primary projects include: 1) the biological signatures of performance; and 2) the biological mechanisms of brain modulation. The first of these projects is focused on the identification of novel biological signatures that are predictive of stress resilience/susceptibility and adaptability. The second project is focused on the identification of the neurobiological pathways by which non-invasive electroceuticals (e.g. transcranial direct current stimulation; tDCS) affect the brain and impact behavior. One of the exciting parts about this work is that brain stimulation is able to induce adaptation factors that result in enhanced synaptic plasticity, giving us an experimental model to test local adaptation mechanisms within the brain that are critical for human performance. Both projects involve rodent models and can involve translational research in human subjects. This position will support current efforts and will also be involved with the design of new experiments to advance the research mission of the Air Force Research Laboratory. Applicants are expected to have a strong background in physiology and research experience in endocrinology, neuroscience and/or molecular biology is preferred. Characteristic duties and responsibilities are listed below.</p>
