I am currently a senior Cognitive Science major and really enjoy learning about all things related to the human brain and mind. CSSA was the first club I joined at Berkeley and I can’t wait to meet all the new members this semester. Outside of classes and CSSA, I work as a research assistant studying memory and learning in young adults and kids where I have gotten the amazing opportunity to learn so much about Cognitive Science from a firsthand perspective. Feel free to reach out to me about questions regarding CSSA, the Cog Sci major, or anything else!</p>

I've been in CSSA since my first semester at Cal when I was still trying to figure out what CogSci was, and I'm really looking forward to being CSSA’s Internal VP. I’m interested in studying the brain from a neurobiological perspective; I’m particularly interested in studying memory formation, decision making, and aging/dementia. Besides the brain, my other interests include ceramics, skiing, teaching, anything by Toni Morrison, and languages. Feel free to come talk to me about CSSA, the major, Neuroscience research, or your favorite dog breeds!</p>

It is such an honor for me to be CSSA’s University Relations this year. In general, my job is to communicate for academic offerings that benefit CogSci students.

You can find me around campus cooking, practicing various martial arts, rock climbing, knitting, juggling, making (mediocre) music, working at Lawrence Hall of Science, and hiding in bio labs pretending to be an MCB major. Come talk to me about being overly interested in things, about the things you're overly interested in, or if you just feel like you need to revitalize your CogSci mojo by petting a brain. </p>

I initially wanted to be a cognitive science major, and that’s how I found this wonderful club.  Even when I decided MCB was an easier major for me, I still wanted to be in CSSA because the club is very chill and welcoming and does amazing things! I will be the outreach co-coordinator this year and am looking forward to seeing the faces of students when we show them the collection of brains. I also spend most of my time working in a research lab, getting through all of the biology lower division requirements, doing triathlons, exploring museums, and surfing! Reach out if you ever want a buddy doing any of those things, or if you're interested in getting involved with outreach!</p>

I am interested in the evolution of the human brain, especially from the biological and cultural aspects. As the historian for CSSA, I mainly just walk around with my camera trying not to offend any fragile unphotogenic human beings. Outside of all the brain stuff, I enjoy playing frisbee, binge scuba diving, reading absurd books, annoying my cat, taking an excessive amount of philosophy classes, or just wasting life with friends doing absolutely nothing. Hit me up if you also feel that overwhelming passion for the human brain or the ocean, or you just want to spend some quality time doing nothing and just be. (It's an existentialist lifestyle).</p>
